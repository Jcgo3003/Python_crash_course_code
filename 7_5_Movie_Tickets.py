# 7-5. Movie Tickets: A movie theater charges different ticket prices 
# depending on a personâ€™s age. If a person is under the age of 3, the t
# icket is free; if they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10; and 
# if they are over age 12, the ticket is $15. Write a loop in which 
# you ask users their age, and then tell them the cost of their movie 
# ticket.
