# 9-3. Users: Make a class called User. Create two attributes 
# called first_name and last_name, and then create several other 
# attributes that are typically stored in a user profile. Make a 
# method called describe_user() that prints a summary of the userâ€™s 
# information. Make another method called greet_user() that prints 
# a personalized greeting to the user.

# Create several instances representing different users, and call 
# both methods for each user.
