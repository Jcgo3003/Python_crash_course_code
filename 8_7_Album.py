# 8-7. Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a dictionary 
# describing a music album. The function should take in an artist name and 
# an album title, and it should return a dictionary containing these two 
# pieces of information. Use the function to make three dictionaries 
# representing different albums. Print each return value to show that the 
# dictionaries are storing the album information correctly.

# Use None to add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to 
# store the number of songs on an album. If the calling line includes a value 
# or the number of songs, add that value to the albumâ€™s dictionary. Make at 
# least one new function call that includes the number of songs on an album.
