# 9-4. Number Served: Start with your program from 
# Exercise 9-1 (page 162). Add an attribute called 
# number_served with a default value of 0. Create 
# an instance called restaurant from this class. 
# Print the number of customers the restaurant has 
# served, and then change this value and print it 
# again.

# Add a method called set_number_served() that lets 
# you set the number of customers that have been 
# served. Call this method with a new number and 
# print the value again.

# Add a method called increment_number_served() 
# that lets you increment the number of customers 
# whoâ€™ve been served. Call this method with any 
# number you like that could represent how many 
# customers were served in, say, a day of business.
