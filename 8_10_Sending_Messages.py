# 8-10. Sending Messages: Start with a copy of your 
# program from Exercise 8-9. Write a function called 
# send_messages() that prints each text message and 
# ves each message to a new list called sent_messages
#  as itâ€™s printed. After calling the function, 
#  print both of your lists to make sure the 
#  messages were moved correctly.
