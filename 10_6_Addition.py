# 10-6. Addition: One common problem when prompting for numerical input occurs when people 
# provide text instead of numbers. When you try to convert the input to an int, youâ€™ll get 
# ValueError. Write a program that prompts for two numbers. Add them together and print 
# the result. Catch the ValueError if either input value is not a number, and print a 
# friendly error message. Test your program by entering two numbers and then by entering 
# some text instead of a number.

number1 = input("Please insert one number ")
number2 = input("Please insert another number ")

try:
	print(f"The addition is {int(number1) + int(number2)}")
except ValueError:
	print("Err: Sorry, please introduce numbers")
